# Image Processing from ZIP File

## Description
This Python project involves processing images within a provided ZIP file containing newspaper images. The task is to search through these images for occurrences of keywords and faces. The script will utilize various libraries to perform tasks such as face detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and image composition to create contact sheets.

## Requirements

- [Library Name 1](link_to_library1): Description of its use
- [Library Name 2](link_to_library2): Description of its use
- ...

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/project_name.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   
## Usage
1. Place the ZIP file containing newspaper images in the designated folder.
2. Run the script `image_processing.py`.
    ```
    python image_processing.py --keyword "pizza"
    ```
   Replace `"pizza"` with the desired keyword to search for.

## Features
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV for detecting faces within images.
- **Keyword Search:** Performs OCR using Tesseract to search for specific keywords within the images.
- **Contact Sheet Generation:** Uses PIL to composite images with detected faces into contact sheets.

## Example
Include an example or screenshot demonstrating how to run the script and what the output looks like.
